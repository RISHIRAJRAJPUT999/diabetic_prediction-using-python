# Diabetes Prediction - Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Diabetes Prediction** system built using **Machine Learning** in Google Colab. The model predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical attributes using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of medical dataset
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- Training and testing using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Evaluation using **accuracy score**
- Lightweight and efficient model

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following medical attributes:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes hereditary factor
- **Age**: Age of the person

The dataset can be obtained from publicly available sources such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📜 Libraries Used
The model is implemented using the following libraries:
- **numpy**: Numerical computations
- **pandas**: Data handling and manipulation
- **StandardScaler**: Feature scaling
- **train_test_split**: Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Classification model
- **accuracy_score**: Evaluating model performance

## 📊 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as:
- Accuracy:  0.7727272727272727%
